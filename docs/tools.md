# Tools

Here is a brief description with valuable documentation of the tools we're using:

## MyPy

MyPy is a statically type checker for python, meaning, it checks the types of the variables and functions in your code and warns you if there is a type mismatch. This is very useful to catch bugs early and to make the code more readable and maintainable.

## Poetry

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install, update, remove) them for you.
